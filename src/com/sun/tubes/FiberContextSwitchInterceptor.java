/**
 * Interception for {@link Fiber<T>} context switch.
 *
 * <p>
 * Even though pipeline runs asynchronously, sometimes it's desirable
 * to bind some state to the current thread running a fiber. Such state
 * may include security subject (in terms of {@link AccessController#doPrivileged}),
 * or a transaction.
 *
 * <p>
 * This mechanism makes it possible to do such things, by allowing
 * some code to be executed before and after a thread executes a fiber.
 *
 * <p>
 * The design also encapsulates the entire fiber execution in a single
 * opaque method invocation {@link FiberContextSwitchInterceptor.Work#execute}, allowing the use of
 * <tt>finally</tt> block.

     * <pre>
     * &lt;R,P> R execute( Fiber f, P p, Work&lt;R,P> work ) {
     *   // do some preparation work

     *
     * <p>
     * While somewhat unintuitive,
     * this interception mechanism enables the interceptor to wrap
     * the whole fiber execution into a {@link AccessController#doPrivileged(PrivilegedAction)},
     * for example.

     *      {@link FiberContextSwitchInterceptor.Work#execute(Object)}.
     * @return
     *      The opaque return value from the the {@link FiberContextSwitchInterceptor.Work}. Simply return
     *      the value from {@link FiberContextSwitchInterceptor.Work#execute(Object)}.
